      <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <p class="subhead">Is there a connection between religion and politics in the USA?</p>
      <div>The United States has a particularly controversial past with regard to the relationship between church and state.  Although the United States was founded in part with the intention of keeping the influence and power of religion out of government, many people follow and vote for political views learned from their respective religious faiths, with the perhaps unintentional result that religious convictions often do influence government policy and law-making, at least indirectly.  I was curious to see how this connection has changed over time and location, or even whether the connection actually exists.</div>

      <h2>PROJECT GOALS</h2>
      <p>Because of the complicated nature of the information in this project, it was very important to map out clear guidelines to follow throughout the process.</p>
      <div class="text-columns">
        <div>
          <h3>No bias</h3>
          <p>Religion and politics are controversial and even taboo topics, and I wanted my infographic to be as easily read and unbiased as possible.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Simplify complicated data</h3>
          <p>Comparing two dense sets of data is complicated and easily misinterpreted and I wanted to provide only the most relevant information to make it simpler for users to compare and digest.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Provide multiple visualizations</h3>
          <p>Each person learns differently, so I provided different visuals for the same information to make the information as easy to understand as possible for diverse users.</p>

      <h2>INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h2>
      <p>I kept the organization of Religion and Politics USA as simple as possible because of the complicated nature of the information it presents. The user can view the main graph three different ways- as a circular bar graph, a linear bar graph, and a dorling map. Both types of bar graphs can be sorted alphabetically or by percentage of religiousness. Users can click on any state in any one of the visualizations and see that stateâ€™s statistics on religion and politics.</p>

      <h2>DESIGN PROCESS</h2>
      <p>One of the most noteworthy things about the process of designing this project was the large amount of iterating I needed to do.  I designed ten different screens for the default graph before deciding on the final design.  I began with the intention of making the information in the form of a heat map, but the result was not easy for the user to understand, so I experimented with a number of different types of graphs before deciding on the circular bar graph design.  I chose that design because it allowed me to communicate much information in a comparatively compact space without confusing the information hierarchy.</p>
