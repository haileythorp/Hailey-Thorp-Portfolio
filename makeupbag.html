      <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <p class="subhead">How can the makeup community benefit from a makeup-centered social media platform?</p>
      <div>As the makeup community has become bigger more and more people have turned to social media to share information and to look for inspiration, tips and product reviews.   Instagram is one of the best resources available to find makeup inspiration.  But now when makeup artists and enthusiasts share a makeup look on Instagram they must either list out each and every product or, instead, provide a link to the list of products that they used for that look.  Providing product reviews in the caption of a photo is also problematic.  The goal of MakeupBag is to create a photo-sharing app that caters specifically to the needs of makeup artists, enthusiasts, and everything in between.</div>

      <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
      <div>There are an abundance of social media platforms available on which makeup enthusiasts can share information, but most of these are either are simply not well-designed for their purpose or are generic sites that are not designed specifically for the makeup community.  Platforms that are not dedicated exclusively to makeup lack features that are the most valuable and important to makeup.  In addition, they also frequently offer useless and irrelevant information.  The best makeup social media platform I was able to find did not organize information well and did not design certain features with the most convenient possible system.</div>

      <h2>VISUAL APPROACH</h2>
      <div>I wanted MakeupBag to look young and crisp and modern so I decided to use black and white, with a pop of fuchsia.  I used sharp, clean lines but broke it up with a black-and-white-line pattern on the sign-in page.  I wanted to make it legible and intuitive while still having a bit more visual interest than a typical social-media app.</div>

      <h2>LESSONS LEARNED</h2>
      <p>When my class was challenged by my professor during my Junior year to design a unique photo sharing app that solves a certain problem, I knew exactly what Iâ€™d do. As a makeup enthusiast myself, I always had thought about how difficult typical photo sharing apps can be for the makeup community. When I was doing work for my portfolio after graduation, I chose to refresh MakeupBag because it has always been an idea that I thought had potential. I had the chance to revisit some of my old design work and see exactly how far I have progressed as a designer. Fixing up MakeupBag really helped me exercise my editing skills and implement all of the new skills I learned over the past year and a half since I first designed it.</p>
