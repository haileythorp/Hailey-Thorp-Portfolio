      <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <p class="subhead">How does someone with 3,000 records keep track of the value of their collection?</p>
      <div>Any collector of anything will tell you that it can be daunting to keep track of just the location of every item in the location, let alone the collection's constantly-changing value.  This is especially true of vinyl records now that they have once again become popular.  The value of a specific record can change dramatically from week to week, and even from day to day.  With so many different pressings, editions and versions of records available, obtaining an accurate appraisal and keeping track of a given record is no small feat.  And the problem only multiplies for larger collections.  Collector was designed so that users may more accurately track the records in their collections and also track the value of those records in real time without having to look the values up on a database.  Collector is especially useful to individuals with large collections, and even to record stores with large inventories.</div>

      <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
      <p>There are many apps and websites available that enable vinyl record collectors to appraise and value their collections.  But despite the many available options there still exist significant gaps in what these resources are able to accomplish for their users, and many of them are inconvenient to use.  The available apps and websites also have a number of weaknesses that are common to all of them.</p>
      <div class="text-columns">
        <div>
          <h3>Not very user centered</h3>
          <p>Many existing apps for vinyl record collecting function primarily as public databases to look up information about individual records, not entire collections.  Some do have features for organizing and analyzing information about a specific person's collection, but such features are often inconvenient and lack detail.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Information gaps</h3>
          <p>Many existing databases are maintained by individual users, which means that much of their information is inconsistent, inaccurate, or missing altogether.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Dense and Disorganized</h3>
          <p>Most consumers do not want or need to know much of the detail about records in a collection.  Those unnecessary details are frequently mixed in with much more significant and useful information, which makes it more difficult to find information that's important to the user.</p>

      <h2>APPROACH &amp; SKETCHES</h2>
      <p>The main goal for Collector was for it to be focused on the user and their record collection.  Some of my initial ideas for achieving this in the site were to create an interactive graph of the user's collection, detail pages about each record, and a camera-recognition feature that would allow users to take a photo of either a record's serial-number barcode, or the front cover of an album, so that the program could accurately identify each record.</p>

      <h2>VISUAL APPROACH</h2>
      <p>My strategy for Collector's visual style was to focus on simplicity and legibility while still maintaining a sense of "coolness."  I wanted to make sure that the style of the app was simple enough that it wouldn't distract from the many styles of album artwork, but that would not look plain or boring, either.  I focused on crisp, sharp lines and the contrast of dark and bright colors.</p>

      <h2>LESSONS LEARNED</h2>
      <p>The biggest obstacle with designing Collector, was the immense amount of detail and information I had to prioritize and juggle. Because there are a lot of factors that contribute to the value of a record, it was really hard to identify which should be prioritized. I really learned the importance of gathering and organizing the appropriate information for a project before fulling diving into it. Another particularly difficult part of creating Collector was the research aspect. The fact that there are a lot of databases and apps that provide information on records meant that I had to carefully pick out the successful and unsuccessful elements of each and determine how to best adapt these ideas to my project. Collector marked an important step in my understanding of UI/ UX design and remains one of my favorite projects to date.</p>
