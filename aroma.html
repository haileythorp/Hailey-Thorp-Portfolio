      <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <p class="subhead">How can we communicate through smell?</p>
      <div>While researching experimental design for my Experimental New Media Design course, I discovered an olfactory-museum exhibit that explored the history of perfume.  The exhibit caused me to think about how I could incorporate scent into a user interface.  We communicate daily through touch, sight, and hearing but we have not learned how to communicate through scent.  Scent is incredibly powerful, capable of evoking emotions and even memories.  How can we use the power of scent to communicate with one another?  My idea for this project centers on the concept of a wearable that possesses the ability to emit, capture, and reproduce smells when prompted with a phone app.  The technology for creating such a wearable is not yet available but soon will be, and my design is intended to be used with this technology when it does.</div>

      <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
      <p>I did an extensive amount of research for this project because of its experimental nature. Most of my research focused on olfactory technologies that already exist, and the various concepts and ideas behind them. I was surprised to find that there are a huge number of projects in progress based on the combination of technology and scent. There is even a scientific society dedicated to this research, the Digital Olfaction society. Some of my favorite experimental projects include an alarm clock that emits a strong scent to peacefully wake the user up, a helmet that uses virtual reality, a helmet that emits scent when someone eats a plain cookie to convince that individual that they are eating a cookie with a flavor different from the one they're actually eating, and many more. Looking into these ideas really allowed me to explore many possibilities for my project.</p>

      <h2>CONCEPT SKETCHES</h2>
      <p>To me, one of the most interesting parts of using scent to communicate is the ability scent gives to communicate in a very subtle way. I wanted to show a story in my concept sketches that illustrates an exciting but realistic use for an olfactory interface.</p>
      <ul class="concept-images">
        <li>
          <img src="images/aroma/CS1.JPG" />
          <p class="concept-text">"User at work, can't text husband"</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="images/aroma/CS2.JPG" />
          <p class="concept-text">"Husband sends scent through Aroma app"</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="images/aroma/CS3.JPG" />
          <p class="concept-text">"User smells scent from husband, understands message"</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>THE NECKLACE</h2>
      <p>I decided to make the Aroma wearable a necklace so the scents can reach the user's nose and still be worn during their normal daily routine.  Because the wearable is a necklace, I wanted its style to be very neutral so that an individual of any gender or style could be comfortable wearing it.  I also thought that is should be comparatively flat so it could be worn comfortably under clothing.  I know how to do metalsmithing, so I thought it was a perfect opportunity to make a prototype.  First I sketched it out, sculpted it in soft wax, then cast it in sterling silver.  I left some of the natural texture from the casting on one side to give it a little more style and visual interest.</p>

      <h2>LESSONS LEARNED</h2>
      <p>Since the technology to implement my design does not yet exist, I had to rely entirely on my imagination in creating Aroma, which helped me pay attention to certain details and see projects from angles that I never had before.  It gave me a new perspective on how to look at and approach design problems, and the research I did was very interesting and was most important to me in making design decisions for the project.</p>
